## Descriptions
---
My motivation for this project was to create an app that asks the User questions about their project, and creates a professional README.md file.I built this project to limit the amount of time a developer needs to put into their README file in order to place more emphasis on their project's code.This solves the problem of having to remember the syntax that goes into each README.I learned how to utilize a separate generateMarkdown Javascript file and export the data gathered for use in the index Javascript file. Utilizing an array of each questions to be called upon using NODE was a helpful tool. I can see how having multiple modules can save time when an app is being run. I never realized what could be going on in the background of an app until this project.This project stands out because it can be very useful for any developer who wants to save time on their projects.

## Complications
---
I ran into complications when I realized that the template literal for the README file's content needed to be in a separate Javascript file. I was not sure how to export it in order for it to be used in the index Javascript. Once I found the appropriate methods to use, I found that some of the collected data was coming back undefined. That just needed a simple fix by adding a return to two of the functions in the generateMarkdown Javascript file.
